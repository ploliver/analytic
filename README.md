# analytic (fork)

This code is based on the code that runs the analytic models described by Hardcastle (2018:
https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.475.2768H/abstract). Certain bugfixes have been done in order for it to run on Python 3.11. Code used to generate the plots from the paper is provided, and several other plots and simulations are also included. 

## Setup instructions

One can follow the setup instructions in [Martin Hardcastle's respository](https://github.com/mhardcastle/analytic). 

Moreover, the bash script `runall.sh` inside the `sims` directory runs all the simulations in our work. The only setup required is to change `python3.11` to the correct version of Python 3.11 or correct name of the Python executable. The script should be able to reproduce the figures in the `sims/figures` directory.

## Usage

For more information on how to use the code, please refer to the original [Martin Hardcastle's respository](https://github.com/mhardcastle/analytic).
